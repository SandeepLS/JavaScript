/*
Sometimes we need to create many objects of the same type.
To create an object type, we use an object constructor function.
*/
//Ex:-Constructor Function for Person objects
      function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
        this.firstName = first;
        this.lastName = last;
        this.age = age;
        this.eyeColor = eye;
      }
      
      // Create a Person object
      const myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
      
      // Display age
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
      "My father is " + myFather.age + "."; 

/*
In the constructor function, this has no value.
The value of this will become the new object when a new object is created.
Def:-In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object, Depending on how it is used.
