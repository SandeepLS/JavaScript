Array & Linkedlist:-

1. Memory Allocation
Array: Uses contiguous memory allocation. All elements are stored in a fixed-size block of memory.
Linked List: Uses dynamic memory allocation. Each element (node) is stored separately in memory and linked using pointers.

2. When to Use What?
Use Arrays when:
> You need fast random access (O(1)).
> You have a fixed number of elements.
> You need better cache locality for performance.
Use Linked Lists when:
> Frequent insertions/deletions are required.
> The number of elements is dynamic and unknown.
> Memory reallocation overhead should be avoided
