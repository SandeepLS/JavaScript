1/ = (Assignment Operator):
  It assigns the value, to the variable on the left.
  Ex: let x = 10;  // Assigns the value 10 to the variable x.
  Ex: let y = "Hello"; // Assigns the string "Hello" to y

2/ == (Loose Equality Comparison):
  It compares two values for equality,after converting both values to a common type (type coercion).
  It only checks for value equality, ignoring the data type.
  Ex: 5 == '5';   // true, because '5' is coerced to the number 5 before comparison.
  Ex: null == undefined;  // true, because null and undefined are considered equivalent.
  console.log(5 == "5"); // true - Type coercion happens, string "5" is converted to number 5
  console.log(0 == false); // true - false is coerced to 0
  console.log(null == undefined); // true - Special case where null and undefined are considered equal

3/ === (Strict Equality Comparison):
  This is the strict equality operator. It compares two values for equality without type conversion.
  It checks both the value and the data type.
  Ex: 5 === '5';  // false, because 5 is a number and '5' is a string
      null === undefined;  // false, because they are of different types  

Summary:
  =  : It assigns the value.
  == : is used to compare two values for equality, with type conversion. 
       It checks only the values, but does not check their data types.
  ===: is used to compares two values for equality without type conversion.
       It checks both the value and the data type.
