/*
Ex:
//x is an object with one property: foo with the value 'bar'.
let x = { foo: 'bar' };

//Create a Shallow Copy of x Using Object.assign:
let y = Object.assign({}, x);
y.foo = 'baz';  //Modify the foo Property in y.

//Since x and y are separate objects, the change made to y.foo does not impact x.foo.
console.log(x.foo);  //bar
