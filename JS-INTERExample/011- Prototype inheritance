/*
  Which of the following is true about prototype inheritance in JavaScript?
  Ans: Prototypal inheritance allows objects to inherit properties directly from other objects.
  
  Ex:
    // Create a prototype object
    const personPrototype = {
        greet: function() {
            return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`;
        }
    };
    
    // Create an object that inherits from the prototype
    const person = Object.create(personPrototype);
    person.name = 'Alice';
    
    console.log(person.greet()); // Output: "Hello, my name is Alice."
  
  Summary:
  Prototypal Inheritance: This example demonstrates how an object (person),
  can inherit properties and methods directly from another object (personPrototype). 
  This is the essence of prototypal inheritance in JavaScript.
