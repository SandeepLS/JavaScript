/*
The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.

myVar = myVar * 5;
will multiply myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar *= 5;
*/
//Ex:Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the *= operator.
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;

/*
Task:
Passed:a should equal 25.
Passed:b should equal 36.
Passed:c should equal 46.
Passed:You should use the *= operator for each variable.
Passed:You should not modify the code above the specified comment.
