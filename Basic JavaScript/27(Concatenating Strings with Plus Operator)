/*
In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.
Example
'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'
Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Example:
const ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";
The string I come first. I come second. would be displayed in the console.
*/
Ex:
const myStr = "This is the start." + " This is the end."; // Change this line

/*
Task:
Passed:myStr should have a single space character between the two strings.
Passed:myStr should have a value of the string This is the start. This is the end.
Passed:You should use the + operator to build myStr.
Passed:myStr should be created using the const keyword.
Passed:You should assign the result to the myStr variable.
