/*
Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the + symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.

Example:

const myVar = 5 + 10;
myVar now has the value 15.
*/
//Ex:-
const sum = 10 + 10;

/*
task:-
Change the 0 so that sum will equal 20.
