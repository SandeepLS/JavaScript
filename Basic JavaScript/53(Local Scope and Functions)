/**Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters, have local scope.
That means they are only visible within that function.

Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc.*/
//Ex:1
function myTest() {
  const loc = "foo";
  console.log(loc);
}

myTest();
console.log(loc);
/**O/P:The myTest() function call will display the string foo in the console.
The console.log(loc) line (outside of the myTest function) will throw an error, as loc is not defined outside of the function.*/

//Ex:2
function myLocalScope() {
  // Only change code below this line
  const myVar = 10;
  console.log('inside myLocalScope', myVar);
}
myLocalScope();

// Run and check the console
// myVar is not defined outside of myLocalScope
console.log('outside myLocalScope', myVar);
