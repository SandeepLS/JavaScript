JavaScript:- JavaScript is a scripting language, you can use to make web pages more interactive. 
It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS, and is supported by all modern browsers.

JavaScript Engine:- JavaScript as a language, as a developer write a code for web application, which will work on the browser.
                    The Browser as to interpret, the browser as converted that code into Machine code.
                    JavaScript engine convert your Js code, and will put it into machine code.
Do we have only one JS engine that's not the case, we have a multiple browser like we have Chrome, firefox, safari, Opera,Netscape.
when we have all thes available browser, they use different JS emgine.
the first engine was spidermonkey developed by Netscape.
Then Chrom as built there own JS engine, which is called V8.It is so populer engine.
the V8 convert that code into machine code, which make it much faster. 
To use V8 that build Run-time environment, which will work on the machine. that the name it as node.js.
using node.js we can build stand-alone application.

/*
In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer.
JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.

For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number 12, and strings, such as "12", "dog", or "123 cats",
which are collections of characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion.
They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.

We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:
*/
Ex:-
var ourName;

/*
creates a variable called ourName. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons.
Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.
*/
