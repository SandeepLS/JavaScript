/*
When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined.
If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number".
If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a string of undefined.

Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined.

Test:-
Passed:a should be defined and have a final value of 6.
Passed:b should be defined and have a final value of 15.
Passed:c should not contain undefined and should have a final value of the string I am a String!
Passed:You should not change code below the specified comment.
*/
//Ex:-
// Only change code below this line
var a=5;
var b=10;
var c="I am a";
// Only change code above this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
