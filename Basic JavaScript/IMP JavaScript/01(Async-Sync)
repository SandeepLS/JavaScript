The differences between asynchronous and synchronous include:

Async is multi-thread, which means operations or programs can run in parallel.
Sync is a single-thread, so only one operation or program will run at a time.

Async is non-blocking, which means it will send multiple requests to a server.
Sync is blocking â€” it will only send the server one request at a time and wait for that request to be answered by the server.

Async increases throughput because multiple operations can run at the same time.
Sync is slower and more methodical.
