/**Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called.
When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters.
The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments*/
//Ex:
function testFun(param1, param2) {
  console.log(param1, param2);
}

//Solution Ex:-
function functionWithArgs(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b);
}
functionWithArgs(1,2);
functionWithArgs(7,9);
