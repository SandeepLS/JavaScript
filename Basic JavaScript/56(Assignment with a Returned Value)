/**Def:-Everything to the right of the equal sign is resolved before the value is assigned.
This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variable.*/
/**Task:-Call the processArg function with an argument of 7 and assign its return value to the variable processed.
         Passed:processed should have a value of 2.*/
//Ex:
// Setup
let processed = 0;
function processArg(num) {
  return (num + 3) / 5;
}
// Only change code below this line
processed = processArg(7);
