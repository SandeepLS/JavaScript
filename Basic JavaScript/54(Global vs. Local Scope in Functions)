/*It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name.
When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.*/

//Ex:
const outerWear = "T-Shirt";

function myOutfit() {
  // Only change code below this line
  const outerWear = "sweater";
  // Only change code above this line
  return outerWear;

}
myOutfit();
