/*Def:-
In the previous challenge, you used a single conditional operator. You can also chain them together to check for multiple conditions.

The following function uses if, else if, and else statements to check multiple conditions:
function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  if (a === b) {
    return "a and b are equal";
  }
  else if (a > b) {
    return "a is greater";
  }
  else {
    return "b is greater";
  }
}

The above function can be re-written using multiple conditional operators:
function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  return (a === b) ? "a and b are equal" 
    : (a > b) ? "a is greater" 
    : "b is greater";
}
It is considered best practice to format multiple conditional operators,
such that each condition is on a separate line, as shown above. 
Using multiple conditional operators without proper indentation may make your code hard to read. For example:

function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  return (a === b) ? "a and b are equal" : (a > b) ? "a is greater" : "b is greater";
}
*/
Test:-
checkSign should use multiple conditional operators
Passed:checkSign(10) should return the string positive. Note that capitalization matters
Passed:checkSign(-12) should return the string negative. Note that capitalization matters
Passed:checkSign(0) should return the string zero. Note that capitalization matters */

Ex:-
function checkSign(num){
  return num > 0 ? "positive" : (num<0) ? "negative" : "zero";
}
console.log(checkSign(10));
O/P:-positive.
