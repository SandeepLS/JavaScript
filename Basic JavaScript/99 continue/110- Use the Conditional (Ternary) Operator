/*Def:-
The conditional operator, also called the ternary operator, can be used as a one line if-else expression.

The syntax is a ? b : c, where a is the condition, b is the code to run when the condition returns true, and c is the code to run when the condition returns false.

The following function uses an if/else statement to check a condition:
forEx:-
function findGreater(a, b) {
  if(a > b) {
    return "a is greater";
  }
  else {
    return "b is greater or equal";
  }
}
forex:-
This can be re-written using the conditional operator:
function findGreater(a, b) {
  return a > b ? "a is greater" : "b is greater or equal";
}

Test:-
checkEqual should use the conditional operator
Passed:checkEqual(1, 2) should return the string Not Equal
Passed:checkEqual(1, 1) should return the string Equal
Passed:checkEqual(1, -1) should return the string Not Equal
*/
Ex:-
function checkEqual(a, b) {
   return a===b ? "Equal" : "Not Equal";
}
checkEqual(1, 2);
O/P:- Not Equal
