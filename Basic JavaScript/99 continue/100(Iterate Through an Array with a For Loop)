/*
A common task in JavaScript is to iterate through the contents of an array. One way to do that is with a for loop. 
This code will output each element of the array arr to the console:
const arr = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6];

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
   console.log(arr[i]);
}
O/P:-10 9 8 7 6
*/
Ex:-
const myArr = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
let total=0;

for(let i=0;i<myArr.length;i++){
  total += myArr[i];
}

//O/P:-total should equal 20.
