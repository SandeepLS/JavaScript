/*Def: One way to think of a multi-dimensional array, is as an array of arrays.
When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outermost (the first level) array,
and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.*/
//Ex:-1
const arr = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
  [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14]
];

const subarray = arr[3];
const nestedSubarray = arr[3][0];
const element = arr[3][0][1];

/*In this example, subarray has the value [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14],
nestedSubarray has the value [10, 11, 12], and element has the value 11 .*/

//Ex:-2
const myArray = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
  [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14],
];

const myData = myArray[2][1];
//Using bracket notation select an element from myArray such that myData is equal to 8.
