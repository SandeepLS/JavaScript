/*
Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

myVar = myVar - 5;
will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:

myVar -= 5;
*/
//Ex:-Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.
let a = 11;
let b = 9;
let c = 3;

// Only change code below this line
a -=6;
b -= 15;
c -= 1;

/*
Task:
a should equal 5.
Passed:b should equal -6.
Passed:c should equal 2.
Passed:You should use the -= operator for each variable.
Passed:You should not modify the code above the specified comment.
