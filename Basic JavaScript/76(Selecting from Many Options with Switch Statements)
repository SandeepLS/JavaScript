/*
If you need to match one value against many options, you can use a switch statement. A switch statement compares the value to the case statements which define various possible values. Any valid JavaScript statements can be executed inside a case block and will run from the first matched case value until a break is encountered.

Here is an example of a switch statement:

switch (fruit) {
  case "apple":
    console.log("The fruit is an apple");
    break;
  case "orange":
    console.log("The fruit is an orange");
    break;
}
case values are tested with strict equality (===). The break tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. If the break is omitted, the next statement will be executed.
*/
Ex:-
function caseInSwitch(val) {
  let answer = "";
  switch(val){
    case 1: answer ="alpha";
            break;
    case 2: answer ="beta";
            break;
    case 3: answer ="gamma";
            break;
    case 4: answer ="delta";
            break;   
  }
  return answer;
}

caseInSwitch(1);

/*
Test:-
case values are tested with strict equality (===). The break tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. If the break is omitted, the next statement will be executed.

Write a switch statement which tests val and sets answer for the following conditions:
1 - alpha
2 - beta
3 - gamma
4 - delta
