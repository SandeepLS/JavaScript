/**Def:-Another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false.
They are basically little on-off switches, where true is on and false is off. These two states are mutually exclusive.*/
/**Task:-Modify the welcomeToBooleans function so that it returns true instead of false.*/

//Ex:-
function welcomeToBooleans() {
  // Only change code below this line

  return true; // Change this line

  // Only change code above this line
}
