/*
You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

The most common type of JavaScript loop is called a for loop because it runs for a specific number of times.

For loops are declared with three optional expressions separated by semicolons:

for (a; b; c), where a is the initialization statement, b is the condition statement, and c is the final expression.
*/
Ex:-1
const ourArray = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}
//ourArray will now have the value [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

Ex:-2
const myArray = [];
for(let i=1;i<=5;i++){
  myArray.push(i);
}
//myArray should equal [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
