/*
If you have multiple conditions that need to be addressed, you can chain if statements together with else if statements.

if (num > 15) {
  return "Bigger than 15";
} else if (num < 5) {
  return "Smaller than 5";
} else {
  return "Between 5 and 15";
}
*/
Ex:-
function testElseIf(val) {
  if (val > 10) {
    return "Greater than 10";
  }

  else if (val < 5) {
    return "Smaller than 5";
  }
  else
  {
    
  return "Between 5 and 10";
  }
}

testElseIf(7);

/*
Task:-
Passed:You should have at least two else statements
Passed:You should have at least two if statements
Passed:You should have closing and opening curly braces for each if else code block.
Passed:testElseIf(0) should return the string Smaller than 5
Passed:testElseIf(5) should return the string Between 5 and 10
Passed:testElseIf(7) should return the string Between 5 and 10
Passed:testElseIf(10) should return the string Between 5 and 10
