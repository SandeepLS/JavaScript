Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). However, unlike the equality operator,
which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.

Examples

3 ===  3  // true
3 === '3' // false
In the second example, 3 is a Number type and '3' is a String type.
*/
//Ex:- Use the strict equality operator in the if statement so the function will return the string Equal when val is strictly equal to 7.

function testStrict(val) {
  if (val===7) { // Change this line
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}
testStrict(10);
testStrict(7);

/*
Task:
Passed:testStrict(10) should return the string Not Equal
Passed:testStrict(7) should return the string Equal
Passed:testStrict("7") should return the string Not Equal
Passed:You should use the === operator
