Programing Language & Programing Paradigms they are two distinct things:-

Programing Language: As we all are aware, Like C, C++, Java & JavaScript. It is independent.

Programing Paradigms: 
-> Paradigm: as method, to solve some problem or do some task.
-> Programming paradigm: is an approach to solve problem using some programming language.
   or also we can say it is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach.

-> Also Programming paradigms refer to the styles and approaches in computer programming,
   that help developers organize and structure their code effectively. 
-> They are essentially guidelines or best practices, adopted by programmers over time.
-> And there is no strict separation among paradigms, and often a mix of different paradigms,
   It can be used depending on the needs of the task or project.
