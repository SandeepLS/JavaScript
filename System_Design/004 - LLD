System Design(high level design):-
Someone gives a requirement, we have to design it.
Ex: Product manager will have some requirement, This is how should function,
And we will transfer the requirement into code.
-
Now idealy wt happens is, given a problem statement is always weight,
We nevwe know, how we are going to build it, wt are the challenges associated with it, how the solution is going to scale, etc, etc...
-
So in that case, what are we going to do?
so we first come up with the design. Let's evaluate what are the posible options, that i can build the system using,
what are the trade time will take doing the system, and then we translate that design into the code.
So that's how, we idealy approach the HLD.
