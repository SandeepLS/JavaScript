Module 10:-
1) System Design:-
System design is the process of desining the architecture, components, modules, & interface/interactions,
of a software system to meet, user specific requirements.
  a) Defining the architecture: This includes the software and hardware architecture.
  b) Interface: Basically interface is anything, to which the user interact.
      Ex:If we want to switch on the TV, our remote is interface.
      System is target of, building a system is to meet user need.
  c) Using modeling languages: Designers use modeling languages to express the information,
     Some examples of modeling languages include Unified Modeling Language (UML), Flowchart,
     Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), and Systems Modelling Language (SysML).

2)Why is SD important:-
System design is a crucial phase, it ensures the developed system meets the specific requirements and,
expectations of the end-users, while maintaining efficiency, scalability, and reliability, -
Reduces Development Time and Costs, Ensures Security and Compliance.

3) High Level Design:-22:00
It is a overview/Quick summary, Like what we are going to implement.
without going into the details.
Ex: When we have these, lot of component like load balance, server, database, cash, api getway.

Low Level Design:-
They are these servers, are were process our request, They will be multiple files like classes, functions etc.
Details of the software, which is running. OR Implementation code.
Ex: When we zoom in on to the server, Which software are running, what is the code, which version

4)Modularity/Modular system/Modular approach:- 25:00
