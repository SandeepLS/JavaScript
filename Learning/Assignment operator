/*
In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).
myVariable = 5;
If there are any calculations to the right of the = operator,
those are performed before the value is assigned to the variable on the left of the operator.
Ex:
var myVar;
myVar = 5;

First, this code creates a variable named myVar. Then, the code assigns 5 to myVar. Now, if myVar appears again in the code,
the program will treat it as if it is 5.
