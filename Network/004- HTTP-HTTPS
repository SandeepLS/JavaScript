Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP):- is a protocol or set of communication rules for client-server communication. 
When you visit a website, your browser sends a HTTP request to the web server, which responds with an HTTP response.
The web server and your browser exchange data as plaintext. In short, HTTP protocol is the underlying technology that powers network communication. 

As the name suggests, hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS):- is a more secure version or an extension of HTTP. 
In HTTPS, the browser and server establish a secure, encrypted connection before transferring data.
