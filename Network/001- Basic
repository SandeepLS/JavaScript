What is the Internet:-
  The Internet is a vast network that connects computers all over the world.
  Through the Internet, people can share information and communicate from anywhere with an Internet connection.
  
  The Internet works by:- connecting networks together through a series of routers and switches. 
  A router forwards packets of data between different networks while a switch links devices within a single network. 
  This enables computers to communicate with each other and access content stored on remote servers.
  
  The components of Internet:-
  End_systems, Router, Link_layer switches & Communication link.
  Ex:-I want to watch a video on Youtube, My network should be connected to the Content Provider Network.
  
  The internet connection is provided by National/Local Internet Service Providers(ISPs).
  
  All Communication activities on the internet are governed by protocals.
  Protocals are a set of rules, that desctibe a standard way of doing things on internet. so that the device can communicated with each other.
  Ex:- TCP, IP, HTTP protocals.

At its core, the internet consists of three key components:-

  Clients: Clients are the devices that users interact with to access the internet. 
    This includes computers, smartphones, tablets, and other internet-enabled devices. 
    When you open a web browser and type in a website address, your device acts as a client, sending requests to servers and receiving responses in return.
  
  Servers: Servers are powerful computers that store, process, and deliver data to clients. 
    They host websites, applications, databases, and other resources that clients request. 
    When you visit a website, your client sends a request to the server hosting that site, and the server responds by sending back the requested data.
  
  Network Infrastructure: The network infrastructure consists of the physical and virtual components that facilitate communication between clients and servers.
    This includes routers, switches, cables, and other networking equipment. T
    he infrastructure ensures that data packets are efficiently routed from their source to their destination, traversing various networks along the way.

The Client-Server Model:-
The interaction between clients and servers on the internet follows a model known as the client-server model. 
In this model, clients send requests to servers for specific resources or services, and servers respond by providing the requested data or performing the desired actions.

Let's break down the steps involved in a typical client-server interaction:

  The client sends a request to the server, specifying the desired resource or action.
  The server receives the request and processes it based on the specified parameters.
  The server generates a response, which may include the requested data or a status code indicating the success or failure of the request.
  The server sends the response back to the client.
  The client receives the response and takes appropriate action, such as displaying the received data to the user.
