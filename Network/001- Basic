What is the Internet:-
The Internet is a vast network that connects computers all over the world.
Through the Internet, people can share information and communicate from anywhere with an Internet connection.

The Internet works by:- connecting networks together through a series of routers and switches. 
A router forwards packets of data between different networks while a switch links devices within a single network. 
This enables computers to communicate with each other and access content stored on remote servers.
