DOM:-
  Using HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.
  When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
  The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp

  The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard, for accessing documents.
  The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:
      Core DOM - standard model for all document types.
      XML DOM - standard model for XML documents.
      HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents.

  The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML.
  In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
