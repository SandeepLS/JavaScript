HTML DOM methods are actions, we can perform (on HTML Elements).
HTML DOM properties are values (of HTML Elements), that we can set or change.

Ex:In the example above, getElementById is a method, while innerHTML is a property.
<html>
<body>
  <p id="demo"></p>
  <script>
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World!";
  </script>
</body>
</html>
