1/ Object:-
  Objects is a collections of key-value pairs, where values can be data (properties) or functions (methods).
  Everything in JavaScript, except for primitives, is an object, including functions and arrays.
  Ex:
  const car = {
    brand: 'Toyota',
    model: 'Corolla',
    startEngine: function() {
      console.log('Engine started');
    }
  };
  const result = car;
  console.log(result);

2/ Classes:
  In ES6 and beyond, JavaScript introduced/Implemented classes to define object blueprints.
  Although it's syntactic sugar over JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance, it gives a more familiar OOP syntax.
  Ex:
  class Car {
    constructor(brand, model) {
      this.brand = brand;
      this.model = model;
    }
  
    startEngine() {
      console.log(`${this.brand} ${this.model} engine started`);
    }
  }

  //Creating an Object Instance:
  const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla');

  Calling a Method:
  myCar.startEngine();

  Explaination:
  // Class Declaration:
    class Car {}: This declares a class called Car. A class in JavaScript is a blueprint for creating objects.
    constructor(brand, model): The constructor is a special method that gets called when a new instance of the class is created. 
    It initializes the object with the values provided. In this case, it takes two arguments: brand and model.
      this.brand = brand and this.model = model: These lines assign the brand and model parameters to the instance’s properties.
      The keyword this refers to the current object (instance) being created.
    startEngine() method: This is a method of the class that can be called on instances of the class. 
  
  //Creating an Object Instance:
    const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla');
      new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla'): This creates a new instance of the Car class, passing 'Toyota' as the brand and 'Corolla' as the model.
      myCar: This is the instance (object) created from the Car class. It has the properties brand = 'Toyota' and model = 'Corolla'.
  
  //Calling a Method:
    myCar.startEngine();
    This calls the startEngine() method on the myCar object.

Key Concepts:
Classes: A way to define a blueprint for objects (in this case, Car).
Constructor: Initializes object properties (here, brand and model).
Object Creation: The new keyword creates a new instance of the class (myCar).
Methods: Functions that belong to an object (in this case, startEngine()).
