1)Synchronous:-Synchronous happens to, execute code in sequential manner.(that line after the other).
Ex:-
const fun2 = () =>{                  //call back function
    console.log("fun2 is starting");
}
const fun1 = () => {                 //call back function
    console.log("fun1 is starting");
    fun2();
    console.log("fun2 is ending");
}
fun1(); //call the function
O/P:-
fun1 is starting
fun2 is starting
fun2 is ending

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2)Asynchronous:- Asynchronous code follow, non sequential manner and unexpected execution time of code.
                 Async is a AJAX Web Application Model.
                 Async request doesn't block the client,...ie Browser responsive. 
                 (Javascript has to wait for an operation to comp[lete, It will execute the rest of the code while waiting.)

Ex:-
const fun2 = () => {
    setTimeout( () =>{
        console.log("fun2 is starting");
    },3000)   
}
const fun1 = () => {
    console.log("fun1 is starting");
    fun2();
    console.log("fun1 is ending");
}
fun1();
O/P:-
fun1 is starting
fun1 is ending
fun2 is starting

-----------------------------------------------We can implement direct in web page also-------------------------------------
<script type="text/javascript">
const fun2 = () => {
    setTimeout( () =>{
        console.log("fun2 is starting");
    },3000)   
}

const fun1 = () => {
    console.log("fun1 is starting");
    fun2();
    console.log("fun1 is ending");
}
fun1();
</script>
