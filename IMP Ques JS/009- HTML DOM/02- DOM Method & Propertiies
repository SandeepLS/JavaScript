HTML DOM methods are actions you can perform (on HTML Elements).
HTML DOM properties are values (of HTML Elements) that you can set or change.
Ex:-
<html>
<body>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    
    <script>
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World!";
    </script>
</body>
</html>

Note:- In the example above, getElementById is a method, while innerHTML is a property.
