callback example:-If i passs the function, inside the another function is known as callback.

  /* you have items in a cart, next step is we have to create 2 api,
  createOrders & processdToPayment. 
  */
  const cart = ["sheo", "pant", "Kurtha"];
  api.createOrder()  //we will tacke callback function, passs along with the cart
  ai.proceedToPayment() //rap this api inside the callback function.

callback hell:-When using multiple nested callbacks, code can become difficult to read and maintain, a situation known as "callback hell." 
      Modern JavaScript uses promises and async/await to mitigate this issue, making asynchronous code more manageable.
    Ex:
    const cart = ["sheo", "pant", "Kurtha"];
    api.createOrder(cart,function(){  //create a order, & make it function
        api.proceedToPayment(function (){
            api.showOrderSummary(function (){
                api.updateWallet();
            });
        })
    } )

Inversion of Controll:-is another problem in callback.
    we see while using callback, we loose controll of our program, because-
    we pass that callback function, to another function,(Now we are giving controol of function, to other function).
