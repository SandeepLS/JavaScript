The differences between asynchronous and synchronous include:

a) Async is multi-thread, which means operations or programs can run in parallel.
   Sync is a single-thread, so only one operation or program will run at a time.

b) Async is non-blocking, which means it will send multiple requests to a server.
   Sync is blocking â€” it will only send the server one request at a time and wait for that request to be answered by the server.

c) Async increases throughput because multiple operations can run at the same time.
   Sync is slower and more methodica
d)Synchronous happens to, execute code in sequential manner.(that line after the other).
  Ex:- var a = 1;
       var b = 2;
       console.log(a);
       console.log(b); 

  Asynchronous happens to, execute code in non sequential manner and unexpected execution time of code.
   genral ex:- it's take call back function, An print out in console loded the page.
       fetch("/", function(){
         console.log("loadded the page");
       })
  Ex:- it's a callback function(setimeout), it's take a callback function to be executed.
      in that case we console log in the helloworld.
      And second argument is the, How many mili second we want to wait,
      it will have the dely of 1 sec, and the it simple printed on helloworld.
        var a = 1;
        setTimeout(function(){
           console.log("Hello World");
        },1000)
        console.log(a);
      O/P:-
      1
      Hello world
      (:-In Synchronous should print first Hello world, after 1,
         In Asynchronous print 1 after Hello World )
