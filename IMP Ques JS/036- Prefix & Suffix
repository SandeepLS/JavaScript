1/ Prefix: 
    Operator is placed before the variable (++x or --x), and the operation is performed before returning the value.
    Ex: 1
    let x = 5;
    let y = ++x; // x is incremented first, then y is assigned the value of x (6).
    console.log(x); // 6
    console.log(y); // 6
    
    Ex: 2
    let x = 5;
    let y = --x; // x is decremented first, then y is assigned the value of x (4).
    console.log(x); // 4
    console.log(y); // 4
    
2/ Suffix (Postfix): 
    Operator is placed after the variable (x++ or x--), and the current value is returned before performing the operation.
    Ex: 1
    let x = 5;
    let y = x++; // y is assigned the current value of x (5), then x is incremented.
    console.log(x); // 6
    console.log(y); // 5
    
    Ex: 2
    let x = 5;
    let y = x--; // y is assigned the current value of x (5), then x is decremented.
    console.log(x); // 4
    console.log(y); // 5
