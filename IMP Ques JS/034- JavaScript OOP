JavaScript is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language:-
-> JS OPPs, it supports the principles of object-oriented design like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism,
   and abstraction.
-> Although JavaScript is not a class-based OOP language like Java or C#, it uses prototypes to achieve
   object-oriented behavior. 
-> In recent years, the introduction of ES6 classes has made the OOP approach more familiar and accessible,
   for developers coming from class-based languages.

  Examples: There are some key concepts of object-oriented programming in JavaScript:-
   1 Object: Collections of properties and methods.
   2 Classes: A class in JavaScript is a blueprint for creating objects.
   3 Encapsulation: Protecting data through controlled access.
   4 Inheritance: Child classes inheriting from parent classes.
   5 Polymorphism: Different objects responding to the same method differently.
   6 Abstraction: Simplifying the interface by hiding complex details.
