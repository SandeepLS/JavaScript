Difference Between Array and List:-

Array	List:-
  > A collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations with a fixed size. Fixed size, defined at the time of creation,-
  > Fixed size, defined at the time of creation.
  > Stores elements of the same data type (e.g., int[], string[] in strongly typed languages).
  
  Ex:
  const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]; // Fixed-size collection
  arr.push(5); // Dynamically add elements, but underlying memory allocation does not expand.

List:-
  > A dynamic collection of elements that can grow or shrink in size as needed.
  > Dynamic size, can be resized automatically as elements are added or removed.
  > Can store elements of different data types, especially in loosely typed languages (e.g., List in Python or ArrayList in Java).

  Ex:
  lst = [1, "text", 3.14]  # Dynamic and can hold mixed data types
  lst.append("new item")   # Easy to add or remove elements
