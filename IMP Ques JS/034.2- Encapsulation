2/ Encapsulation
  Definition: Encapsulation is the practice of keeping properties and methods private to the object,
  Then controlling access to them through public methods. This helps maintain data integrity.
  Implementation: JavaScript doesn't have explicit private properties, but the convention is to use _ or
                  modern syntax (using closures or #).
  
  Example (using # for private fields):
  class Car {
    #mileage = 0;
  
    constructor(brand, model) {
      this.brand = brand;
      this.model = model;
    }
  
    drive(distance) {
      this.#mileage += distance;
      console.log(`Mileage is now ${this.#mileage}`);
    }
  }
  const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla');
  myCar.drive(40);  //Mileage is now 40
