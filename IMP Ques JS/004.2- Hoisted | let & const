A) Hosting:-first we should understand the "Execution context".
            In the temporal ded zone, for time B.
        Ex:-
        var a = 10; //These variable a, was attached to the Global object.
        console.log(a);
        O/P:-10
        
        Ex:-
        console.log(a);
        var a = 10;
        O/P:-undefine

        Ex:-
        console.log(b);
        let b = 20;  //These variable b, is attached to different Memory space the Global, in that case we get a error.(let & const)
        var a = 10;  //These variable a, is attached to the Global object. But Incase of let & const, they are also allocated memory.that is known as Hosting.
        O/P:-Cannot access 'b' before initialization
        
        Ex:-let a = 10;
        console.log(a);
        O/P:-10
        
        Ex:-console.log(a);
        let a = 10;
        O/P:-Erroe:- cannot access a, before initializing
        
        Ex:-const a = 10;
        console.log(a);
        O/P:-10
        
        Ex:-console.log(a);
        const a = 10;
        O/P:-Erroe:- cannot access a, before initializing

B)Refference error:- If i try to access x, in my js code. But it is not declear in JScode.
                     In that case we will get refference error:- x is not defined at JScode.
                    Ex:- x is not declear/defined in JS code.
                    var a = 10;
                    console.log(x);

                    Ex:-a is in the temporal ded zone.
                    console.log(a);
                    let a = 10;

                    Ex:-Undefined
                    console.log(a);
                    var a = 10;
                    
C)SyntaxError:-If we declear the variable, without initialization.
              Ex:-
              const a;

              Ex:- Identifier 'b' has already been declared 
              let b = 20;
              let b=30;
              console.log(b)

D)TypeError:- const b variable is constant. it should be initialize as well as declear together.
              You cannot assign value, leter on.
              const b = 100;
              b = 200;
              O/P:-typeError
              
E)Window Object:- In JS code variable a, attached to the Global object. Note:- let & const variable we can not access.
                Ex:-
                var a = 100;
                var b = 200;
                O/P:- go to console, type:- window.a / this.a
