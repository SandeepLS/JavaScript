Coercion:- is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another in JavaScript.
This happens when operators or functions expect specific data types, but the provided values are of different types.

There are two main types of coercion in JavaScript:

1)Type Conversion (Explicit Coercion):
  This occurs when you explicitly, convert a value from one type to another using functions or methods.
  like String(), Number(), Boolean(), or parseInt(). For example:
  Ex:
  let num = 123;
  let str = String(num); // Explicitly converts number to string
  
2)Type Coercion (Implicit Coercion):
  This happens automatically by the JavaScript engine when values of different types are used together, 
  especially in operations like comparisons or arithmetic. For example:
  Ex:
  let num = 123;
  let str = "456";
  let sum = num + str; // "123456", num is coerced to a string

Common Cases of Coercion
  String Coercion:
    When using the + operator with a string, the other operand is coerced into a string.
    Example: "5" + 2 results in "52".
  
  Number Coercion:
    When using arithmetic operators (-, *, /, etc.), JavaScript tries to convert the operands to numbers.
    Example: "5" - 2 results in 3 because the string "5" is coerced into a number.
  
  Boolean Coercion:
    In a boolean context (like an if statement), values are coerced to true or false.
    Falsy values include false, 0, "" (empty string), null, undefined, and NaN.
    Truthy values include, true, 42, "sandeep", [], {}, function().
    Example: if ("") will not execute because an empty string is falsy.
  
  Equality Coercion
    The == operator compares values for equality after performing type coercion if the types are different.
    This can lead to unexpected results, so it's generally recommended to use the === operator,
    which does not perform type coercion and checks for both value and type equality.
    For example:
    0 == false; // true, because 0 is falsy
    0 === false; // false, because 0 is a number and false is a boolean
