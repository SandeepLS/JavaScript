1. Type of Language
Java: A statically typed, object-oriented programming language.
JavaScript: A dynamically typed, interpreted scripting language.

2. Execution Environment
Java: Runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and is platform-independent (Write Once, Run Anywhere).
JavaScript: Runs in web browsers (via the V8 engine in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox, etc.) and on servers (Node.js).

3. Use Cases
Java: Used for backend development, enterprise applications, Android development, and desktop applications.
JavaScript: Used primarily for web development, front-end scripting, interactive web pages, and backend development (Node.js).

4. Syntax and Paradigm
Java: Uses a strict OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) approach (Classes, Objects, Inheritance).
JavaScript: Supports OOP, functional, and event-driven programming.

5. Compilation vs. Interpretation
Java: Compiled into bytecode (.class files) before execution.
JavaScript: Interpreted by the browser or the Node.js runtime.

6. Dependencies
Java: Requires installing the Java Development Kit (JDK).
JavaScript: Runs in the browser without additional installation.

7. Concurrency Model
Java: Uses multi-threading.
JavaScript: Uses event-driven, single-threaded (but non-blocking via async/await and promises).

Key Takeaway
Java is a full-fledged programming language for applications across multiple platforms.
JavaScript is a scripting language mainly for web development.
