Def:-The onunload attribute fires, once a page has unloaded (or the browser window has been closed).
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body onunload="myFunction()">

<h1>Welcome to my Home Page</h1>

<p>Close this window or press F5 to reload the page.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Due to different browser settings, this event may not always work as expected.</p>

<script>
function myFunction() {
  alert("Thank you for visiting W3Schools!");
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
