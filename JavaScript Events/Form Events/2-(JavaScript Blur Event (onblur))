/*
JavaScript Blur event is opposite of Focus event, it triggers when an element looses its focus.
So, blur is a situation when an element gets unfocused after getting focused. The onblur event handler is used to handle this event.

Example of onblur form event
In the example of onblur event, an alert box gets displayed to inform the user that the input field has loses its focus.
Notice that in this example the event handler is not calling any user-defined function.
It is calling JS's in-built alert() function because we just want to give textual information to the user.

You are free to experiment with the code. Make your functions and try different styles.
