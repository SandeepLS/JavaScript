render():-
The render() method, is used to define what a component should display on the screen. 
It returns a React element, that represents the UI structure of the component. 
Render responsible, How the UI looks & Fell to the user.

In class components, render() is a required method, while functional components simply return JSX.

Example:-
import React, { Component } from "react";

class Welcome extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to React.</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default Welcome;

index.js:-
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import Welcome from "./Welcome";

ReactDOM.render(<Welcome name="John" />, document.getElementById("root"));

Explanation:
1. What it Does:
   > The render() method returns JSX, which describes the component's UI.
2. How it Works:
   > If name="John" is passed as a prop to the Welcome component, it will render:
    Hello, John!
    Welcome to React.
3. When it Runs:
   The render() method is invoked whenever the component needs to update or display the UI, 
   such as after a state or prop change.
