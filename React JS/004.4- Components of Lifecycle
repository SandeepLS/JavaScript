Component LifeCycle:-Basically explain, stages the component goes through.

It can be devide into 3 parts:-
(a)Mounting:-                                                                                    Mounting:-
    The first thing will invoked in LifeCycle, that is componentWillMount()                 componentWillMount()
    It is invoked write to for the, initial rendering occurs.                                       |
    Then we have a rendering method[render()].                                                  render()
    Once the Comp is inserted into the DOM, componentDidMount is invoked.                           |
                                                                                            componentDidMount()
                                                                                            
(b)Updation:-
    When a component recive props, componentWillReciveProps() gets invoked,                      Updation:-
    setstate(): is called when the state of the properties are changed.                     componentReciveProps()      setState()
    So everytime there is a change, react decides, weather the next Comp state-                       | 
    should trigger a re-render or not.To do that[shouldComponentUpdate()],                  shouldComponentUpdate()
    componentWillUpdate(), is invoked before rendering.                                               |
    After the rendering-                                                                      componentWillUpdate()
    componentDidUpdate(), is called that makes update to the DOM.                                     |
                                                                                                  render()
                                                                                                      |
                                                                                              componentDidUpdate()

(c)UnMounting:-
    componentWillUnMount():- is called while unMounting the component.
    It performs any clean up necessary.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
->componentWillMount(): is called immediately, before initial rendering occurs.
->componentDidMount(): is invoked after, react component inserted into the DOM.
