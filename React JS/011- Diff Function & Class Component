In React, both function components and class components can be used to create UI elements,
but they differ in how they handle state, lifecycle methods, and overall structure.
Here’s a comparison between the two:

1/ Syntax:
    Function Component:
      Simpler and more concise.
      A function that returns JSX.
    const MyComponent = () => {
      return <div>Hello from Function Component!</div>;
    };
    
    Class Component:
      More verbose.
      Defined as an ES6 class that extends React.Component.
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <div>Hello from Class Component!</div>;
      }
    }

2/ State Management:
  Function Component:
    Before React 16.8, function components were stateless. 
    With the introduction of Hooks (e.g., useState), function components can now manage state.
    const MyComponent = () => {
      const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
    
      return (
        <div>
          <p>Count: {count}</p>
          <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
      );
    };
  
  Class Component:
    State is managed using the this.state object, and setState() is used to update the state.
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
          count: 0,
        };
      }
    
      increment = () => {
        this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
      };
    
      render() {
        return (
          <div>
            <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
            <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
          </div>
        );
      }
    }

3/  Lifecycle Methods:
  Function Component:
    Function components do not have lifecycle methods like componentDidMount or componentDidUpdate.
    Instead, Hooks like useEffect are used to handle side effects.
    const MyComponent = () => {
      React.useEffect(() => {
        // Component did mount or update
        return () => {
          // Cleanup (like componentWillUnmount)
        };
      }, []); // Empty array means this effect runs only on mount
    
      return <div>Hello from Function Component with useEffect!</div>;
    };
  
  Class Component:
    Class components use specific lifecycle methods for handling side effects:
    ->componentDidMount
    ->componentDidUpdate
    ->componentWillUnmount
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      componentDidMount() {
        console.log('Component mounted!');
      }
    
      componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
        console.log('Component updated!');
      }
    
      componentWillUnmount() {
        console.log('Component will unmount!');
      }
    
      render() {
        return <div>Hello from Class Component with Lifecycle!</div>;
      }
    }

4/ Hooks vs. Lifecycle Methods:
    Function Component: Hooks (like useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.) 
    are used to replace class lifecycle methods and add functionality.
    
    Class Component: Lifecycle methods are used to control behavior,
    during component mounting, updating, and unmounting.\

5/ Performance:
    Function Component:
    With React 16.8+ and Hooks, function components tend to be more lightweight and
    have slightly better performance in certain scenarios because they avoid the overhead of class methods.
    React can optimize function components more easily, especially with techniques like memoization (React.memo).
    
    Class Component:
    Class components, due to their more complex nature (binding this, managing lifecycle methods), 
    may have a bit more overhead, but the difference is usually negligible in typical apps.

6/ this Keyword:
  Function Component:
    There’s no need to use this in function components. You directly reference props, state, and functions.
    const MyComponent = (props) => {
      return <div>{props.message}</div>;
    };
  
  Class Component:
    You must use this to reference props, state, and methods inside the class.
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <div>{this.props.message}</div>;
      }
    }

7/ Event Handlers:
  Function Component:
    Event handlers are simple functions without the need to bind this.
    const MyComponent = () => {
      const handleClick = () => console.log('Clicked!');
      return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
    };
  
  Class Component:
    Event handlers require explicit binding of this unless you use arrow functions.
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
      }
    
      handleClick() {
        console.log('Clicked!');
      }
    
      render() {
        return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me</button>;
      }
    }
