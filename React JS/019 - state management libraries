State management libraries used in React:

1. React Context API
  > Overview: Built into React, it helps share state across components without passing props down manually at every level.
  > Best for: Small to medium applications where state-sharing is limited.
  > Example Use Cases: Theme toggles, authentication state, language settings.

2. Redux
  > Overview: A popular library for managing global state using a unidirectional data flow.
    It relies on actions, reducers, and a centralized store.
  > Best for: Large applications with complex state requirements.
  > Example Use Cases: E-commerce carts, complex user interactions, API-driven apps.
  > Extensions:
    Redux Toolkit: Simplifies Redux setup with pre-configured tools.
    Middleware: Redux Thunk, Redux Saga.

3. Zustand
  > Overview: A small, fast, and scalable state management library with minimal boilerplate.
  > Best for: Simple and performance-critical apps.
  > Example Use Cases: Lightweight state management for components.

4. MobX
  > Overview: A simple and scalable state management library that uses observables for reactive state management.
  > Best for: Applications needing real-time updates and minimal boilerplate.
  > Example Use Cases: Dashboards, collaborative tools.
