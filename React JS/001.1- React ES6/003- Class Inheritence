Class Inheritance:-
To create a class inheritance, use the extends keyword.
A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class.

Ex: Create a class named "Model" which will inherit the methods from the "Car" class:
class Car {
    constructor(name) {
      this.brand = name;
    }
  
    present() {
      return 'I have a ' + this.brand;
    }
}
  
class Model extends Car {
    constructor(name, mod) {
      super(name);
      this.model = mod;
    }  
    show() {
      return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model
    }
}
  
const mycar = new Model("Ford", "Mustang");
//document.write(mycar.show());
console.log(mycar.show());  //I have a Ford, it is a Mustang

Note:-
The super() method refers to the parent class.
By calling the super() method in the constructor method,-
we call the parent's constructor method and get access to the parent's properties and methods.
