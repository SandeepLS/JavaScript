Error Boundaries in React:-
It Handling errors in React components, gracefully by using componentDidCatch or ErrorBoundary components.

Error boundaries are React components, that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, 
log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire application.
They are implemented using either the componentDidCatch lifecycle method or React's built-in ErrorBoundary mechanism.

Key Points:
1. Scope of Error Boundaries:
   > Error boundaries only catch errors in their child components, not in themselves or event handlers.
   > They do not catch errors in asynchronous code (like setTimeout), server-side rendering,
     or errors thrown in the error boundary itself.
2, When to Use:
   > To gracefully handle rendering errors and prevent them from crashing the entire React app.
