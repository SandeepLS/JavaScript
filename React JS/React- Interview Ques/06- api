REST API:-
Representational State Transfer, is a web-based Application Programing Interface, that follows the rest architectural style.
*)Primary purupose of rest, is to provide an architecture for building web-services, that can be consumed by various clients,

  this means the server doesn't store any information about the client's state between request. insted-
  each request contains all the necessary information. require by the server to process the request.
  This architecture makes rest api scalabel & easy to maintain.

When use rest api:-
  Building web-services that requira a stateless, scalable, & easy=to maintain.
  It ideal for building applications, that require crud operation(create, read, update, felete).
  rest api is also suitable for building application, that require real-time communication.-
  such as Chat application, Streaming services.
