React is a UI library, rather then a UI frameworks like Anguler & Vue.

Frameworks are strict & highly opinioted, in terms of how we write, the code of our application,
while libraries are extremely unopinionated, on how we built out our logic.

Libraries allows us to use multiple third party packages & libraries(like, Redux, MobX, HookState =>these are state management),
while it's little strict with framework.


SAP: we are in the same HTML page, & we just changing the component.
react is unMounting one block, & mounting another blocks.
