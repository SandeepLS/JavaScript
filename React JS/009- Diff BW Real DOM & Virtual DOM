Real DOM:-
  Real DOM is the actual structure of the webpage.
  React Update complete document in the Real DOM.
  React DOM is the actual webpage rendered on the browser any changes,
    made directly reflect on the complete webpage.

Virtual DOM:-
  Virtual DOM is the virtual representation of Real DOM.
  React update the state changes in Virtual DOM first and then it syncs with Real DOM.
  Virtual DOM is just like a blueprint of a machine, can do changes in the blueprint but,
    those changes will not directly apply to the machine.

1. Definition:-
Real/Actual/Browser DOM: The Real DOM is the actual, live, and directly manipulatable structure, of a web page in browser memory.
Virtual DOM: The Virtual DOM, on the other hand, is a lightweight JavaScript abstraction, representing the web page’s structure in memory.

2. Updation:- 
Real DOM: If Any changes triggers/happens, an immediate update to the Real DOM.
Virtual DOM: React updates the Virtual DOM, instead of the Real DOM, when changes occur.

3. Representation:-
Real DOM: is Not just a JavaScript representation; it’s the actual DOM structure of HTML elements.
Virtual DOM: JavaScript representation of DOM elements and properties.

4. Rendering:-
Real DOM: Rendered directly in the browser’s view.
Virtual DOM: Not rendered in the browser’s view; used by React for updates and optimizations.

5. Developer Friendly:-
Real DOM: Complex and requires manual optimizations for performance.
Virtual DOM: Offers a more declarative and user-friendly API; optimizations handled by React.
