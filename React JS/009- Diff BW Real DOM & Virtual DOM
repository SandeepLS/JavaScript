  Real DOM is the actual structure of the webpage.
  React Update complete document in the Real DOM.
  React DOM is the actual webpage rendered on the browser any changes,
    made directly reflect on the complete webpage.

Virtual DOM:-
  Virtual DOM is the virtual representation of Real DOM.
  React update the state changes in Virtual DOM first and then it syncs with Real DOM.
  Virtual DOM is just like a blueprint of a machine, can do changes in the blueprint but,
    those changes will not directly apply to the machine.
