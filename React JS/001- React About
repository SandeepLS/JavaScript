Def:- Reactjs is a Javascript library, for building Fast &
  interactive user interface. for Web as well as Mobile application.
  It is a open-source.
  Which allows us to create, Reusable component in our web application. & makes our UI building much more simpler.
  In a Model View Controller, React is a View,-
  which means is responsible for, how the app looks like & fell.

Ex:- Let's see the react works in real-time.
  Take an example of Instagram page.
  The entire of UI designed into an 5 component,
  -Search component
  -Profile description component
  -Status component
  -Post list component
  -Single post component
  Which is make, code easier to debug &
  each component has it's own property & function.

Why:-
  Easy creation of Dynamic web application.
  Performance Enhancement.
  Reusable component.
  Unidirectional data flow.
  Small learning curve.
  It can be allow use mobile application.
  Dedicated tools for easy debugging.

Features:-
(a)JSX:- is a syntax extention to Javascript.
  It is used with React, What the user interface should looks like.
  By using JSX, we can write HTML structure,
  in that same file, contains Javascript code.
  JSX is the combination of HTML & JS, HTML + JS = JSX.
  Ex: const simple = <h1>Hello World</h1>;

(b)Virtual DOM:- Data Object Model.
  It define, How document can be access/How manipulating on web pages.
  DOM treats an XML/HTML document, as tree structure.
  Note:-That Virtual DOM, is the exact copy of Real DOM.
  Manipulating the Real DOM is much slower, Then manipulating Virtual DOM,-
  because nothing gets drown onscreen.

(c)Performance:- React is a Virtual Component.

(d)One-way data binding:- Keeps everything Moduler & Fast.
  A unidirectional data flow, means When design a react app,
  you need often, child component within parent component.

(e)Extention:- React has many ecxtention, that we can use to create 
  Full flex content application.
  It provide server side rendering, means the application are render on the server,-
  rather then browser.
  Extention:-
  React Native:- It builds mobile apps, using only Javascript.
                 React native app is a, Real Mobile app.
  Flux:- is a application architecture, that facebook uses.
         it unidirectional flow.

(f)Debugging:- React application are extremly easy to test.
  due to large developer community.

Note:- when ever u type in input, it will change state to h1 tage.
import React from 'react'
import { useState } from 'react'

function  Header() {
    const [search, setSearch] = useState('');

    function searchProduct(e){
        setSearch(e.currentTarget.value);
    }
  return (
    <header>
        <input type='search' name='' id='' onChange={searchProduct} />
        <h2>{search}</h2>
    </header>
  )
}

export default Header;
