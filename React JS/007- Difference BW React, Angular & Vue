React:-
  Feature:
    -Is open-source, front end Javascript library.
    -Library is set of Class & Function, An User complete controll to call them.
    -React is Used to Mobile & Web Development.
    -React was develop & maintain by Facebook.
    -React represents the view part, of the MVC framework.
  UseCase:
    -Facebook, Instagram, Netflix
  Performance:
    -React uses virtual DOM to fill in data, in the HTML DOM.
    -DOM(Document Object Model):when a web page is loaded, tthe Browse creates a DOM of the page.
     DOM is an API, that defines how a document is accessed & manipulated. DOM represents a document with a logical tree.
    -DOM, :Only the changed Objects, get update in the RealDOM.
    -Virtual DOM makes, React extremely Fast.(No time-consuming).
  Data-binding:
    -React only uses, one-way binding.
    -First, the model state is Updated. And then it renders the change in the UI element(view).
    -Model --> View
  Scripting language:
    -React combines UI templates and Javascript logic. The result is called JSX.
    -React only required the knowledge of Javascript.
  Test:
    -Jest is used by Facebook, to run tests on React.
    -It is embedded in every react library And zero configuration.

Anguler:-
  Feature:
    -Is open-source, JS Framework.
    -Framework is like a Module, they have limited choices,-
     and come with a blue print of their own. As a result User doesn't have much controll.
     So JS being a Interpreted language, when code is executed line by line, Make all these toll-
     Very efficient. Mainly is converted code into interpreted code with required Run-time environment.
    -Anguler is used for Single Page Application & also develop Hybrid application.
    -Anguler is Build By Google.
    -Angular is a Full fledged MVC framework.
  UseCase:
    -Nike, HBO, SONY 
  Performance:
    -Angular uses real DOM.
    -This will update entire tree structure of HTML tags.
    -It is Time-Consuming, risky & can attract a lot of bugs.
  Data-binding:
    -Angular uses, two-way binding.
    -Any changes made in the UI element. is is reflected in the coresponding model state And vice versa.
    -Model <--> View
  Testing:
    -Is used to Jasmine.

Vue:-
  Feature:

    -Framework is like a Module, they have limited choices,-
     and come with a blue print of their own. As a result User doesn't have much controll.
     So JS being a Interpreted language, when code is executed line by line, Make all these toll-
     Very efficient. Mainly is converted code into interpreted code with required Run-time environment.

  Performance:
    -Vue uses virtual DOM to fill in data, in the HTML DOM.
    -Vue updates any alterd HTML. & does not update the entire tree.
    -This ensure faster & bug free.
  Data-binding:
    -Vue uses, two-way binding.
    - Model <--> View
  Testing:
    -unit testing with Jest or Mocha.
